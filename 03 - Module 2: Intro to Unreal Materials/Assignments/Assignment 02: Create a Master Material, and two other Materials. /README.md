# Assignment 02: Create a Master Material, and two other Materials. 

<p>This assignment, you will build a master material that you can use to quickly add textures (from custom props, or megascans). Then you will create a material instance of the material, populate it, and use it some way in your level. Try to be creative with your material.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you will create two other materials that you can use in your environment that follow the physical parameters of specific metal or glass types in the Unreal Engine Documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Note: One of these materials needs to be animated and consist of material layers.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will submit screenshots of your material networks for each material</li>
<li>You will submit a screenshot of your material used in a level in a creative way that makes sense with your environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will need to make a video of your animated material.&nbsp;</li>
