# Assignment 06: Data Driven Blueprint System, Spline Mesh and Python API

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Utilize Unreal Engine 5 to create a dynamic environment feature using the Spline Mesh Tool, manage game data with Data Tables, and automate a simple task using UE5's Python API. This assignment aims to solidify your understanding of UE5's tech art capabilities, preparing you for advanced game development and digital art projects.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Spline Mesh Creation:</strong> Design and implement a dynamic object or environment feature using the Spline Mesh Tool. Ensure your creation demonstrates versatility and enhances the visual appeal or interactivity of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Table Management:</strong> Create a Data Table in UE5 to manage game data related to your project. This could involve character stats, item properties, or environmental variables. Demonstrate how this data table streamlines the development process or gameplay experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python API Automation:</strong> Write the python scripts in the video tutorials and get them to function in an editor utility widget in Unreal. For extra credit, you can create a python script of your own to automate something of your choosing in the engine. Please keep in mind that this is encouraged, but not required.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A video that showcases your spline mesh blueprint</li>
<li>A video that showcases your data driven blueprint system</li>
<li>A video that showcases the use of your python scripts</li>
<li>Screen shots of your blueprints</li>
<li>Screen shots of your python scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your videos and screenshots to SyncSketch and then submit the link to Canvas</p>
