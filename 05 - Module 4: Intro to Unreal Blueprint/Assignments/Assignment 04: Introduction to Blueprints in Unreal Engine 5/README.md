# Assignment 04: Introduction to Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>This assignment aims to introduce students to the foundational concepts of visual scripting using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. Students will apply their knowledge to create a series of interactive objects commonly used in game design. The goal is to familiarize students with the Blueprint interface, node-based logic constructions, and the practical application of these elements in creating interactive game mechanics.</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5 are a powerful visual scripting system that can be used to create intricate behaviors and interactions in game environments without the need for traditional coding. Through this assignment, students will develop a clear understanding of how to manipulate actors and components within the UE5 editor to achieve specific gameplay functionalities.</p>
<h4>Assignment Tasks:</h4>
<p>Each student is required to create the following Blueprints:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Moving Platform:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Design a platform that moves between two or more points when triggered.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Moving Components, vector interpolation, activation events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Triggered Fire Particle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Set up a fire effect that activates when the player enters a specific area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Particle systems, trigger volumes, event begin overlap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump Pad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Create a pad that launches the player into the air upon contact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Physics impulses, collision detection, Blueprint Interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atmospherics Changer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a system that changes environmental effects (e.g., fog density, ambient lighting) when the player enters a designated area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Environmental settings, triggers, Event Dispatchers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Door:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Construct a door that opens automatically as the player approaches.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Proximity detection, Timelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive Door:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Implement a door that the player can open and close via an input command.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Input handling, state toggling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Door with Lock and Key:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Design a door that only opens when the player has obtained a specific item (key).</li>
<li>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Moving components, conditional checks, line traces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Utilize the Unreal Engine 5 editor to construct each Blueprint.</li>
<li>Ensure each Blueprint is fully functional and integrates properly within a test level environment.</li>
<li>Provide concise comments within your Blueprints to explain the logic and purpose of the nodes used.</li>
<li>Submit a brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing the functionality of each Blueprint and any challenges encountered during the creation process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Submission Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots of commented Blueprints</li>
<li>Video demonstration of each Blueprint functioning within the game environment.</li>
<li>Post screenshots and Blueprints on SyncSketch and then submit your link here on Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Evaluation Criteria:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Functionality (40%):</strong> All Blueprints work as described without errors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Complexity (20%):</strong> Demonstrates creative and effective use of Blueprint nodes and logic structures.</li>
<li>
<strong>Documentation (20%):</strong> Clear, informative comments in the Blueprints and thoroughness in the written report.</li>
<li>
<strong>Presentation (20%):</strong> Clarity and quality of the video demonstration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assignment not only enhances your technical skills in using Unreal Engine 5 but also prepares you for more complex game development tasks involving Blueprints in future projects.</p>
