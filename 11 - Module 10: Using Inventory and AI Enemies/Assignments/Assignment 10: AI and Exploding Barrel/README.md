# Assignment 10: AI and Exploding Barrel

<div class="ig-row  ig-published">
<div class="ig-info">
<div class="module-item-title"><span>This assignment integrates immersive lessons on dynamic game environments and AI behavior with practical skill labs in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). You are challenged to apply techniques for developing waypoints, checkpoints, managing game states, and creating AI characters with complex behaviors. Your goal is to create interactive game elements that enhance player experiences through environmental interactivity and advanced AI mechanics.</span></div>

<h4>Part 2: Flying AI Drone - Skill Lab 1</h4>
<h5>Tasks:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>AI Navigation and Movement</strong>: Program three-dimensional patrol paths and movement for the drone.</li>
<li>
<strong>AI Perception and Behaviors</strong>: Implement AI perception to enable the drone to detect targets and define chase and attack behaviors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Combat Mechanics</strong>: Develop attack mechanics that allow the drone to engage with detected targets.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Part 3: Dynamic Game Environment and AI Behaviors</h4>
<h5>Lesson Integration:</h5>
<p>Implement foundational and advanced techniques from the lesson on dynamic game environments and AI behavior, focusing on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Waypoints and Checkpoints</strong>: Establish waypoints for AI navigation and checkpoints that save and load game progress, including player locations and weapon inventories.</li>
<li>
<strong>Saved Game States</strong>: Design a system to manage and load saved game states, ensuring weapon inventories and AI statuses are preserved across sessions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Complex AI Programming</strong>: Script AI characters to perform behaviors such as wandering, patrolling, chasing, jumping, and executing ranged attacks.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Video Demonstrations</strong>: Videos showcasing the functionality of the exploding barrel, flying AI drone, and the dynamic game environment with AI behaviors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Screenshots:&nbsp;</strong>Include Screenshots of your blueprints, behavior trees and other assets</li>
<li>Upload all items to SyncSketch and Submit a link to Canvas.</li>
</ul>
