<h3>Assignment: Implementing a Modular Game Development Architecture in UE5</h3>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Utilize Unreal Engine 5 to create a comprehensive game architecture that includes a modular weapon system, animation montages for weapon actions, a weapon inventory with switching functionality, a game save system, and a checkpoint system for player location. This assignment aims to solidify your understanding of scalable and flexible game development practices.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Modular Weapon System Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement a base weapon class in UE5 that can be easily extended for various weapon types (e.g., pistol, rifle, shotgun).</li>
<li>Ensure each weapon type has unique properties (damage, fire rate, ammo capacity) and functionalities (shoot, reload).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animation Montages for Weapon Actions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create animation montages for different weapon actions such as shooting, reloading, and switching.</li>
<li>Integrate these animations with your weapon system, ensuring they are played correctly in response to player actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weapon Inventory and Switching</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop an inventory system that allows the player to carry multiple weapons and switch between them.</li>
<li>Implement a UI element that displays the current weapons in the inventory and indicates the active weapon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Game Save System</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a save system that records the player's current weapon inventory, including the state of each weapon (ammo count, equipped status).</li>
<li>The save system should also store the player's progress and can be loaded upon game restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checkpoint System for Player Location</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a checkpoint system where the player's location is saved at certain points in the game level.</li>
<li>Allow the player to respawn at the last checkpoint upon game reload or character death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>&nbsp;Exploding Barrel - Skill Lab 1</h4>
<h5>Tasks:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Blueprint Scripting</strong>: Utilize Blueprints to create interaction logic for the barrel that triggers an explosion when damaged.</li>
<li>
<strong>Particle System and Sound Effects</strong>: Implement an explosion particle effect paired with sound effects to simulate a realistic explosion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Damage Mechanics</strong>: Script the explosion to deal damage within a specified radius, affecting nearby entities.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Screenshots</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will post screenshots of your Blueprints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Demonstration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3-5 minute video showcasing your weapon system in action, including animation montages, inventory switching, and the functionality of the save and checkpoint systems. Highlight key features and any unique implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
