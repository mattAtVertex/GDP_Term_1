# GDP Milestone 12: Final Presentation Lesson Plan

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Objective</strong></span></p>
<p>You made it! Great Job!</p>
<p>This week, you will polish up your games and try to fix any bugs left in your games. You will also give a 3-5 minute presentation about your game using google slides and submit an exe of your game, screenshots, gameplay footage, and a game trailer. All items will be placed in a google drive folder and shared with me. Remember to set the sharing access to anyone with the link.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Presentation</strong></span></p>
<p>The presentation should contain the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of what your game is about</li>
<li>What are the core mechanics of your game?</li>
<li>What challenges did you overcome while making your game?</li>
<li>What have playtesters said about your game?</li>
<li>If you could do it over again, what would you do differently?</li>
<li>When giving a presentation like this, it should be more visual that literary. The slides should have more pictures than words. Try to capture your audience with the visuals that you have created.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Executable File</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">You will submit a packaged game for windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Screenshots</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">You will submit 5 high resolution screen shots of your game on SyncSketch and the Google Drive folder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Gameplay Footage</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">You will submit 1 minute of raw gameplay footage on syncsketch and the Google Drive folder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Game Trailer</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">You will submit a 30 second game trailer showcasing your best footage. Try to make the trailer attractive. Think about game trailers that you like or reference game trailers of games that are successful. Try to deduce from these references what makes a game trailer good and entertaining. You will submit the game trailer on sync sketch and the Google Drive Folder.</p>
