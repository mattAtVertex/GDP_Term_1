<h3><span>Program Description</span></h3>
<p><span>The Game Development bootcamp at Vertex School introduces you to the real-time skills that define the core of most game development disciplines. In this program, you will learn the fundamentals of the game development pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span>The program is going to do this through a simplified game development pipeline. First thing you’re going to make a level; put some stuff in that level; light it, and set up materials; design the game loop; program the characters and the environment; create the UI and package it up.</span></p>
<p><span>Working inside of unreal engine, you build skills in environment, tech art, programming, tool building, and game design. We’re super excited to have you here and look forward to seeing what dreams you come up with.</span></p>
