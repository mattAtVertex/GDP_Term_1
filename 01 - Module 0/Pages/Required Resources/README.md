<h3><span>Doing The Work</span></h3>
<p><span>At Vertex, our focus is on the work. Every topic is accompanied by assignments where you will practice the techniques you have learned. You will receive feedback both from your mentors and your peers, just as you will be providing feedback to your peers. Our mantra is Post Early, Post Ugly, and Post Often. The more you post, the more opportunities you have to receive feedback and the more feedback you receive, the more you grow.</span></p>
<p><span>Always make sure your work updates are posted in the appropriate place </span><i><span>before</span></i><span> you meet with your mentor or class. A mentor should never have to ask you for your work. You should always be prepared ahead of time and eager to share. When in doubt on when you should post work updates, remember:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Early is on time</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>On time is late</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Late is unacceptable</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Community Participation</span></h3>
<p><span>During the course you will interact with instructors, mentors, and other students. While much of your live interaction will be in small groups or one on one with mentors, every student is still expected to participate in the community. You will be posting updates to your work to your designated cohort channels where your peers have the opportunity to provide feedback on your work. You will also participate in providing feedback for your peers’ work. As developers, we grow stronger through both mentor and peer critique.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Grading and Evaluation</span></h2>
<p><span>There are two types of assignments:</span></p>
<p><strong>Skill Building Assignments</strong><span>: Small projects that you work through to demonstrate an understanding of the topic. These are deadline based and primarily aimed at learning the technical skills. These are graded on a per assignment basis. As these are skill based, meeting deadlines is 75% of the grade for each assignment. The remaining 25% for each assignment is based on mastery of the skill topic.&nbsp; Turning in your assignments on time (meeting the deadline or earlier) usually means a 100% for that assignment.</span></p>
<p><strong>Project Milestones:</strong><span> Milestones act as checkpoints during capstone projects. While you should aim to hit the deadlines, these are more about honing your skills and tend to be more flexible. Project milestones are about achieving the quality threshold. Capstone projects are assigned a completion grade at the end of the project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rubric: </strong><span>During The Game Capstone projects, your game will be evaluated on the specific job hiring triggers used in the industry:</span></p>
