<li aria-level="1"><span>Build custom tools to aid in the creation of your 3D application</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Prerequisites</span></h3>
<p><span>Students should have a general knowledge of game development, 3D modeling programs and computer games.</span></p>
<h3><span>Course Breakdown and Schedule</span></h3>
<h4><span>Intro to Game Development (Skill Building)</span></h4>
<p><span>The first course is about skill building while gaining a general understanding of the Game Development Pipeline. You will be learning technical skills and discovering workflows that align with industry standards. You will develop your modeling and texturing skills while simultaneously adapting to pipelines specifically tailored to Real Time 3D applications. These skills apply to many industries that utilize real time rendering.</span></p>
