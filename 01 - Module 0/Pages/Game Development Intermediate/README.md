# Game Development Intermediate

<h3><span>Course Description</span></h3>
<p><span>In the intermediate game development course, you will take the skills that you have learned in foundations to create a game capstone, which will be a more enhanced experience than your first game. In this course you will learn the technical skills you need to create an engaging game that can function as a minimum viable product (MVP).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to these technical skills, you will also learn how to work with Unreal Engine’s python and C++ API’s to further develop your development skills. These are the techniques used by all successful AAA game studios.&nbsp; Video games are not the only industry where these skills are relevant. Many industries (not just games) are moving towards heavier usage of real time technology. Game, film, VR.... even healthcare and logistics!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span>Course Breakdown and Schedule</span></h3>
<h4><span>Intermediate Game Development</span></h4>
<p><span>The aim of this course is to get you thinking like a game developer or technical artist. This means shifting your focus to be able to see both the entire game and the individual mechanics. Each sprint you will be learning topics and theories that are essential to Unreal Engine generalists and technical artists. Game Developers have a large toolkit they need to master, so our main focus here will be getting acquainted with these topics as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<h4><span>Game Capstone II</span></h4>
<p><span>Now that you have a more advanced skill set, it’s time to start building your 3D application.</span></p>
<p><span>In the intermediate game capstone, it’s time to build a more complete 3D application. This application can be a game or other type of 3D interactive product. While you are working on your project, you will also be following along with an instructor’s project as they go through the process. We will spend time fixing bugs, optimizing code, and building functionality in efficient ways. The capstone will be evaluated based on milestones.</span></p>
<p><span>The course is managed using a milestone system. Each week, you will complete milestones that can include a concept component, development component and a programming component. Each milestone component will be completed weekly.&nbsp;</span></p>
