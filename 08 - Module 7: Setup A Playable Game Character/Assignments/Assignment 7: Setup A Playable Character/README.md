# Assignment 7: Setup A Playable Character

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Utilize Unreal Engine's Enhanced Input, Animation Retargeting, MetaHuman, Animation Blueprints, and Animation Montages to develop a custom playable character. This assignment aims to combine the technical and creative aspects taught in the course, resulting in a character ready for gameplay integration.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p>Enhanced Input Configuration: Implement an advanced input system for your character, ensuring smooth and responsive control for actions such as walking, jumping, and interacting.</p>
<p>Animation Retargeting: Select a set of base animations and retarget them to your custom character model. This should include key animations like running, jumping, and idle.</p>
<p>MetaHuman Character Creation: Use MetaHuman to create a realistic human character. Customize the appearance to fit the concept of your playable character.</p>
<p>Animation Blueprint Setup: Develop an Animation Blueprint for your character, integrating the retargeted animations to control the character's movement and actions within the game.</p>
