<p>Objective:<br>Build a comprehensive weapon pickup system in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints. This system should allow players to spawn in a level, pick up different types of weapons, and have the player character's animations change based on the weapon they are currently wielding. Your task will focus on applying and expanding upon the concepts discussed in the lesson, including utilizing Blueprints for spawning weapons, implementing pickup mechanics, and swapping animations according to the equipped weapon.</p>
<p>Tasks:<br>Weapon Blueprint Creation:</p>
<p>Create Blueprint classes for at least three different types of weapons. Each weapon should have unique properties (e.g., fire rate, damage).<br>Design the weapons to be spawnable objects within the game world, placing them strategically in a test level.<br>Pickup System Implementation:</p>
<p>Develop a pickup system that enables the player character to collect weapons by interacting with them. Use collision detection and Blueprint interfaces to trigger the pickup event.<br>Ensure the player can switch between collected weapons, either through input commands or UI selection.<br>Animation Swapping:</p>
<p>Utilize animation Blueprints and state machines to change the player character's animations based on the currently equipped weapon.<br>Implement at least one unique animation set per weapon, covering actions such as idle, running, and firing.<br>Signage Master Material:</p>
<p>You will create a signage master material so you can have a large amount of signage in your level while having a minimal effect on draw calls.</p>
<p><br>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Screenshots</p>
<p>You will upload screenshots of all your blueprints and material node graphs.<br><br>Video Demonstration:</p>
<p>Provide a 2-3 minute video showcasing the functionality of your weapon pickup system. This should include clips of the player picking up weapons, switching between them, and the corresponding animation changes.<br>Highlight any unique features or mechanics you implemented beyond the basic requirements.</p>
<p>You will upload your video demo and screenshots of your blueprints to SyncSketch and then submit a link to Canvas</p>
