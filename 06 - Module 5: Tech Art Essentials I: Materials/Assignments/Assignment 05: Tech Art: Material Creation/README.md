# Assignment 05: Tech Art: Material Creation

<p>The objective of this assignment is to develop proficiency in material creation in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) using specific nodes and techniques. Students are expected to create three distinct materials utilizing the nodes Dot Product, Sine &amp; Cosine, World Space Normals, Vector, Distance Field, Tri Planar, and Landscape Slope Material. Additionally, they will develop a Water Shader and a Vertex Paint Material. This task aims to enhance students' understanding of shader programming and material design within UE5.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Material Creation using Specific Nodes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop three different materials using the following nodes: Dot Product, Sine &amp; Cosine, World Space Normals, Vector, Distance Field, and Tri Planar.</li>
<li>Each material should showcase a unique application of these nodes, demonstrating the studentsâ€™ understanding of their functions and properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Water Shader</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement a Water Shader. This shader should simulate realistic water properties, such as reflection, refraction, and movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertex Paint Material</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a material that utilizes Vertex Painting to blend between different textures or effects. This material should allow dynamic changes in the game environment using vertex paint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Material Demonstrations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots or short videos showcasing each of the three materials created using the specified nodes.</li>
<li>Visual demonstrations of the Landscape Slope Material, Water Shader, and Vertex Paint Material in action within a UE5 scene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will submit sreenshots and video of your materials to SyncSketch and then submit the link here on Canvas.</p>
